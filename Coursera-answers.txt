In this situation, it is quite difficult for me to raise such a large sum of money for the certificate.
Financial Aid will allow me to pursue this course without jeopardizing my monthly critical necessities, hence I am in desperate need of it.
I want to finish (course name) and I want to take the course offered by (course provider).
This course will improve my work opportunities when I graduate from my institute. 
It will help me perform better in carrying out (course technology) and provide me a competitive advantage.
A validated certificate will provide legitimacy to the certificate I will acquire as a result of this course.
As I have done in past Signature Track Courses, I intend to finish all assignments on time or early.
I also plan to engage in Discussion Forums, which I have found to be an excellent addition to my learning in the previous online courses I have done on Coursera.
I also want to assess peer-reviewed work, which I feel will be a wonderful learning experience.
