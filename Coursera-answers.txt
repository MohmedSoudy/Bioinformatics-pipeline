I’m a student from (Country name) and want to learn (course name). I think it will be beneficial for my thesis work. 
But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course.
In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate.
Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. 
So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.
I want to complete (course name) and Want Course on offer by (course provider).
This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute.
It will help perform better in carrying out (course technology) and give me an edge over my competitors.
A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.
I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses.
Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning
immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments
which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
